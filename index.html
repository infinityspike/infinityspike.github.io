<h1>J Russ</h1>

<p>Yo, I'm J! I'm from Canton Ohio and graduated from Jackson High School. I have 2 cats, Fred and George (yes from Harry Potter). I'm a big fan of DCI, I like both Santa Clara and the Bluecoats. I'm love tinkering and CAD, if you want something designed for 3D printing hmu! R&B/alt pop and EDM are 3 or my fav music genres-artists like Benee, bbno$, Zedd, Galantis, Marshmello, etc. I love all things hiking, biking, and boarding</p>
